						<h2>About us</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="about__text">
						<p>In today's world, where technology is playing an increasingly important role, search and interaction between drivers and passengers are becoming easier and more convenient thanks to our innovative application. Our mission is to ensure comfortable and safe movement of people around the city, country or the world.</p>
						<p>APPrideUSA offer a simple and convenient solution that allows drivers and passengers to find each other in a matter of minutes. Thanks to our platform, you will be able to reach your destination quickly and safely without worrying about finding the right transport.</p>
						<p>Our app unites drivers and passengers based on their preferences and needs, which allows you to create individual routes and save time and money. We strive to ensure that every user can find a suitable option for their trip, whether it's a short trip around the city or a long trip to another city.</p>
						<p>How does our app work? It's very simple: you specify your route, choose the departure time. Then our app selects the most suitable travel options for you from different drivers. You can choose the most suitable option for you and contact the driver to clarify all the details of the trip.</p>
						<p>One of the main advantages of our application is security. All drivers have reviews from previous passengers. </p>
						<p>Our team APPrideUSA is constantly working to improve our application to make it even more convenient and secure for users.</p>
						<p>Do not forget that sharing transport is not only convenient, but also profitable.</p>

						<h5>Website Visitors</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="popup-policy__paragraph">
						<p>Like most website operators, APPrideUSA collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. APPrideUSA 's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how APPrideUSA 's visitors use its website. From time to time, APPrideUSA may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
						<p>APPrideUSA also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on APPrideUSA.com blogs/sites. APPrideUSA only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>

						<h5>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h5>

In each case, APPrideUSA collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with APPrideUSA. APPrideUSA does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
